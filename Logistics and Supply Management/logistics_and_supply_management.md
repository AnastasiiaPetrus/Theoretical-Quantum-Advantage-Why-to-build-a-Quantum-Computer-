# Logistics and Supply Management: Algorithm and Method Extraction, Mapping, and Quantum Analogue Status

## Introduction

This file documents the full process and results of algorithm and method extraction, clustering, practical use assessment, and quantum analogue mapping for the domain of Logistics and Supply Management.

## Search Parameters

- **Keywords:** `logistics and supply management AND algorithm`
- **Platforms:** IEEE Xplore, Semanticscholar, Springer
- **Time window:** 2023–2025
- **Sample size:** 100 open-access articles per keyword/platform combination

_Other parameters, keywords, and platforms can be adjusted as needed._

## Selection Process Overview

For the domain of Logistics and Supply Management \(D\), we compile a broad list of classical algorithms and methods \(A\) known to be used in the field. We then assign an **importance score** \(\mathcal{I}(A, D)\) to each algorithm or method based on:
- its frequency in domain-specific scientific literature, and
- whether it is confirmed to be practically used in that domain.

Formally:
\[
\mathcal{I}(A, D) = \mathrm{fpub}(A, D) \times \mathrm{fuse}(A, D)
\]
where  
- \(\mathrm{fpub}(A, D)\) is the normalized frequency of mentions of \(A\) in the literature (see below),  
- \(\mathrm{fuse}(A, D)\) is a binary indicator: 1 if \(A\) is in practical/operational use in domain \(D\), 0 otherwise.

## Process Summary

- Articles were collected and reviewed for explicit mentions of algorithms or methods in titles and full texts.
- All classical algorithms and methods were extracted, then clustered by name and application similarity.
- For each cluster, practical use (\(\mathrm{fuse}\)) was assigned based on real-world applications found in recent literature, case studies, and industry reports from 2023 to 2025.
- Quantum analogue status was mapped for each practically used cluster, based on current literature in quantum algorithms and quantum machine learning.

## Table Legend

- **Algorithm & Method:** Standardized cluster of related algorithms and methods (variants unified).
- **mentions:** Number of literature references in the aggregated sample (2023–2025).
- **fpub:** Normalized publication frequency (\( \mathrm{fpub}(A, D) = \frac{\text{mentions}}{\sum_{A'} \text{mentions}} \)).
- **fuse:** Practical use in logistics and supply management (`1` = yes, `0` = no).
- **\(\mathcal{I}(A, D)\):** Importance score; only methods with \(\mathcal{I}(A, D) \geq \theta\) (here, \(\theta = 0.01\)) are considered significant for quantum mapping.

## Quantum Analogy

Classical algorithms dominating logistics and supply chain management—including Genetic Algorithms, PSO, ACO, Simulated Annealing, LP/ILP, and various machine learning methods—have corresponding quantum analogues or inspired quantum algorithms in research or early development stages.

Notably:  
- **Quantum Annealing** (QA) is a mature quantum approach for combinatorial optimization problems like SA and VRP.  
- **Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA)** is a leading candidate to solve LP/ILP-style constrained optimization problems on near-term quantum devices.  
- **Quantum Genetic Algorithms** and **Quantum Swarm Intelligence** methods are under active investigation but are not yet widely adopted operationally.  
- Quantum machine learning models, such as **Quantum CNN**, **Quantum LSTM**, and **Quantum Random Forest**, have been proposed to handle logistics forecasting and classification challenges, though practical applications are nascent.

The convergence of classical and quantum algorithm research in logistics reflects the growing interest in harnessing quantum speedups for large-scale combinatorial and predictive problems.

## Notes

- All Top-10 classical algorithms and methods have confirmed practical use in logistics and supply management, as verified by `fuse=1`.
- Quantum analogues exist or are proposed for every Top-10 algorithm, with maturity varying from early research (e.g., QGA) to relatively advanced (QA, QAOA).
- The importance score correlates well with both practical adoption and the presence of quantum algorithm research.
- The broad algorithm diversity mirrors the interdisciplinary challenges in logistics and supply chain optimization and forecasting.
