# Supplementary Table S1. Practical Use of Classical Algorithms in Logistics and Supply Management

## Overview

This supplementary material systematically maps classical algorithms to their real-world adoption in logistics and supply chain management. Each algorithm or method is assessed using the **fuse** (Field Use Evidence Score) criterion, which is set to `1` if the method is actively applied in practical workflows (operational, industrial, or widely used in logistics studies from 2023-2025), otherwise `0`.  
Evaluation is based on recent literature, case studies, and industry reports from 2023-2025.

## Table Legend

- **Algorithm & Method**: Cluster of related algorithms or models (including variants and common abbreviations).  
- **fuse**:  
  - `1`: Demonstrated and established practical use in logistics and supply chain management.  
  - `0`: No significant evidence of practical application or only theoretical use noted.
