## Summary and Observations

- **Genetic Algorithms** dominate as the most frequently cited optimization method across supply chain and logistics problems, often in hybrid or multi-objective forms.
- **Swarm intelligence methods** like PSO and ACO are widely applied for routing, scheduling, and resource allocation.
- **Metaheuristics** such as Simulated Annealing and Tabu Search have steady presence for combinatorial problems like Vehicle Routing (VRP).
- **Mathematical programming** approaches (LP, ILP) remain foundational, especially for exact or approximation frameworks.
- **Machine Learning and Deep Learning** methods, particularly CNNs and LSTMs, are increasingly integrated for forecasting, demand prediction, and route optimization.
- **Reinforcement Learning** and **Deep Reinforcement Learning** start to gain traction in dynamic decision-making contexts.
- **Blockchain and consensus algorithms** appear in the context of supply chain transparency and security.
- Specialized heuristics (e.g., Solomon heuristic) and problem-specific algorithms (multi-agent, scheduling) complement classical methods.
- Quantum algorithms, though emerging, have limited but notable mention in logistics optimization.
- **Hybrid and multi-objective evolutionary algorithms** are widely employed to address complex logistics optimization under uncertainty and multiple criteria.
- The diversity of algorithms reflects the broad interdisciplinary nature of modern logistics and supply management research.
