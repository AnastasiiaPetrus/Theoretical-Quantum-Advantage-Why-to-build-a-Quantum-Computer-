# Supplementary Table S2. Standardized and Aggregated Algorithm Frequency (fpub)

## Overview

To ensure reproducibility and comparability of results on algorithm usage in logistics and supply management domain, we systematically aggregated data from recent peer-reviewed articles collected from IEEE Xplore, SemanticScholar, and Springer (2023-2025). Extracted algorithm names were standardized by harmonizing synonyms, abbreviations, and closely related variants. Mentions were counted across all sources, and normalized publication frequency \( fpub \) was calculated as:

\[
fpub = \frac{\text{mentions}}{301}
\]

with total mentions summed as **301** for unbiased comparison.

## Table Legend

- **Algorithm & Method**: Cluster of related algorithms or methods.
- **mentions**: Absolute count of mentions across surveyed literature.
- **fpub**: Normalized frequency of mentions relative to total (301).

## Total mentions: **301**

*Note:*  
- Mentions were counted by identifying standardized algorithm clusters across the provided dataset of 100 articles.  
- \( fpub \) values are rounded to 3 decimal places.  
- Algorithms with low mentions (<2) or very specific variations are omitted here
