## Standardization and Aggregation of Algorithm Frequency (fpub)

To ensure reproducibility and comparability of results on algorithm usage in climate and environmental research, we systematically aggregated data from three independent online repositories of peer-reviewed articles. Each source provided a list of algorithms and methods as cited in recent research, but with considerable variability in nomenclature, abbreviations, and variants.

**Standardization Process:**
- All extracted algorithm names were harmonized through manual review, with synonyms and abbreviations unified under a single standard label.
- Algorithmic variants and closely related models were clustered together (e.g., all Random Forest modifications are grouped as “Random Forest” with variants listed in parentheses).
- For each standardized method, we computed its **fpub** value, defined as the total number of times the algorithm or method was referenced across all sources. This metric quantifies the relative prevalence of each algorithm in the literature.
- The resulting table provides a deduplicated, standardized reference list with fpub for each algorithm.
