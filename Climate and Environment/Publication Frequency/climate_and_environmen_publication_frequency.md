# Supplementary Table S2. Standardized and Aggregated Algorithm Frequency (fpub)

## Overview

To ensure reproducibility and comparability of results on algorithm usage in climate and environmental research, we systematically aggregated data from three independent online repositories of peer-reviewed articles. Each source provided a list of algorithms and methods as cited in recent research, but with considerable variability in nomenclature, abbreviations, and variants.

**Standardization Process:**
- All extracted algorithm names were harmonized through manual review, with synonyms and abbreviations unified under a single standard label.
- Algorithmic variants and closely related models were clustered together (e.g., all Random Forest modifications are grouped as “Random Forest” with variants listed in parentheses).
- For each standardized method, we computed its **fpub** value, defined as the total number of times the algorithm or method was referenced across all sources. This metric quantifies the relative prevalence of each algorithm in the literature.
- The resulting table provides a deduplicated, standardized reference list with fpub for each algorithm.

---

## Table Legend

- **Algorithm & Method**: Cluster of related algorithms or methods.
- **fpub**: The number of times the method was mentioned in the aggregated, deduplicated literature survey (higher = more prevalent in recent research, 2010–2024).
