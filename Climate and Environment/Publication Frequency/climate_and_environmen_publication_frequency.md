# Supplementary Table S2. Standardized and Aggregated Algorithm Frequency (fpub)

## Overview

To ensure reproducibility and comparability of results on algorithm usage in climate and environmental research, we systematically aggregated data from three independent online repositories of peer-reviewed articles. Each source provided a list of algorithms and methods as cited in recent research, but with considerable variability in nomenclature, abbreviations, and variants.

**Standardization Process:**
- All extracted algorithm names were harmonized through manual review, with synonyms and abbreviations unified under a single standard label.
- Algorithmic variants and closely related models were clustered together (e.g., all Random Forest modifications are grouped as “Random Forest” with variants listed in parentheses).
- For each standardized method, we counted the number of times (**mentions**) the algorithm or method was referenced across all sources.
- For every algorithm, we calculated the **normalized publication frequency (fpub)** as:
    - \( \text{fpub} = \frac{\text{mentions}}{\text{Total mentions}} \)
    - Here, **Total mentions = 1032** (sum of all *mentions* in the table).
    - The *fpub* value represents the share of total mentions and allows unbiased comparison of algorithm importance.
- The resulting tables provide a deduplicated, standardized reference list with both *mentions* and *fpub* for each algorithm.

## Table Legend

- **Algorithm & Method**: Cluster of related algorithms or methods.
- **mentions**: The number of times the method was mentioned in the aggregated, deduplicated literature survey (absolute count, 2010–2024).
- **fpub**: The normalized publication frequency, i.e. \( \frac{\text{mentions}}{1032} \).

## Total mentions: **1032**
