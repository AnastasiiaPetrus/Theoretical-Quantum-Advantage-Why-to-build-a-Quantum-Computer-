# Climate and Environment: Algorithm Extraction and Mapping

## Introduction

This file documents the full process and results of algorithm extraction, clustering, practical use assignment, and quantum analogue mapping for the domain of Climate and Environment.

## Search Parameters

- **Keywords:** `climate`, `environment`, `climate AND algorithm`
- **Platforms:** arXiv, Scopus, Springer
- **Time window:** 2024â€“2025
- **Sample size:** 100 most relevant articles per keyword/platform combination

## Process Summary

- Articles were collected and reviewed regardless of explicit mention of algorithms in abstracts or titles.
- All classical algorithms and models were extracted, then clustered by name and application similarity.
- For each cluster, practical use (fuse) was assessed based on real-world applications found in open literature.
- Quantum analogue status was mapped for each practically used cluster.

## Supporting Notes

- Random Forest and Extra Trees were clustered together due to similar use and methodology.
- Practical use (fuse) for K-means was confirmed by application in public climate modeling datasets.
- Quantum analogue for Linear Regression: see [Quantum Linear Regression Paper](link).
