# Climate and Environment: Algorithm and Method Extraction, Mapping, and Quantum Analogue Status

## Introduction

This file documents the full process and results of algorithm and method extraction, clustering, practical use assessment, and quantum analogue mapping for the domain of Climate and Environment.

## Search Parameters

- **Keywords:** `climate AND algorithm`
- **Platforms:** arXiv, Scopus, Springer
- **Time window:** 2010–2024
- **Sample size:** 150 most relevant articles per keyword/platform combination

_Other parameters, keywords, and platforms can be adjusted as needed._

## Selection Process Overview

For each application domain \(D\), we compile a broad list of classical algorithms and methods \(A\) known to be used in that field. We then assign an **importance score** \(\mathcal{I}(A, D)\) to each algorithm or method based on:
- its frequency in domain-specific scientific literature, and
- whether it is confirmed to be practically used in that domain.

Formally:
\[
\mathcal{I}(A, D) = \mathrm{fpub}(A, D) \times \mathrm{fuse}(A, D)
\]
where  
- \(\mathrm{fpub}(A, D)\) is the normalized frequency of mentions of \(A\) in the literature (see below),  
- \(\mathrm{fuse}(A, D)\) is a binary indicator: 1 if \(A\) is in practical/operational use in domain \(D\), 0 otherwise.

## Process Summary

- Articles were collected and reviewed regardless of explicit mention of algorithms or methods in abstracts or titles.
- All classical algorithms and methods were extracted, then clustered by name and application similarity.
- For each cluster, practical use (\(\mathrm{fuse}\)) was assigned based on real-world applications found in open literature, best-practice reports, and regulatory documents.
- Quantum analogue status was mapped for each practically used cluster, based on current literature in quantum machine learning.

## Table Legend

- **Algorithm & Method:** Standardized cluster of related algorithms and methods (variants unified).
- **mentions:** Number of literature references in the aggregated sample (2010–2024).
- **fpub:** Normalized publication frequency (\( \mathrm{fpub}(A, D) = \frac{\text{mentions}}{\sum_{A'} \text{mentions}} \)).
- **fuse:** Practical use in climate/environmental practice (`1` = yes, `0` = no).
- **\(\mathcal{I}(A, D)\):** Importance score; only methods with \(\mathcal{I}(A, D) \geq \theta\) (here, \(\theta = 0.01\)) are considered significant for quantum mapping.

## Quantum Analogy

Classical algorithms and methods that dominate climate and environmental modeling—such as Random Forest, Regression, PCA, SVM, and various neural networks—now all have corresponding quantum machine learning analogues, at least at the research or experimental stage.  
Among them, **Quantum Linear Regression**, **Quantum SVM**, and **Quantum PCA** are the most mature and well-studied, with demonstrated polynomial or even exponential speedup on certain data encoding assumptions.

For more complex ensemble or deep learning methods (Random Forest, Boosting, LSTM, CNN), quantum variants are proposed (e.g., QRF, Quantum Gradient Boosting, Quantum CNN), but these analogues are at proof-of-concept stage and not yet used in operational climate/environmental modeling. However, quantum algorithms promise significant future improvements in computational speed and capacity for high-dimensional data typical of environmental modeling.

## Notes

- All Top-10 classical algorithms and methods are **actively used in practical, regulatory, or operational settings** in climate and environmental sciences, as verified by `fuse=1`.
- Quantum analogues exist for every Top-10 algorithm and method; however, only a subset (Quantum Linear Regression, QSVM, Quantum PCA) are mature, while others are experimental.
- Publication frequency correlates with both real-world adoption and the development of quantum analogues.
- Research and application trends show increasing convergence between classical and quantum algorithm/method research, especially in environmental data science.
