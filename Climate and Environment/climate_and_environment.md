# Climate and Environment: Algorithm Extraction and Mapping

## Introduction

This file documents the full process and results of algorithm extraction, clustering, practical use assignment, and quantum analogue mapping for the domain of Climate and Environment.

## Search Parameters

- **Keywords:** `climate AND algorithm`
- **Platforms:** arXiv, Scopus, Springer
- **Time window:** 2010–2024
- **Sample size:** 150 most relevant articles per keyword/platform combination

_Other parameters, keywords, platform can be adjusted as needed._

## Process Summary

- Articles were collected and reviewed regardless of explicit mention of algorithms in abstracts or titles.
- All classical algorithms and models were extracted, then clustered by name and application similarity.
- For each cluster, practical use (FUSE) was assessed based on real-world applications found in open literature, best-practice reports, and regulatory documents.
- Quantum analogue status was mapped for each practically used cluster, based on current literature in quantum machine learning.

## Quantum Analogy

Classical algorithms that dominate climate and environmental modeling—such as Random Forest, Regression, PCA, SVM, and various neural networks—now all have corresponding quantum machine learning analogues, at least at the research or experimental stage. Among them, **Quantum Linear Regression**, **Quantum SVM**, and **Quantum PCA** are the most mature and well-studied, with demonstrated polynomial or even exponential speedup on certain data encoding assumptions.

For more complex ensemble or deep learning methods (Random Forest, Boosting, LSTM, CNN), quantum variants are proposed (e.g., QRF, Quantum Gradient Boosting, Quantum CNN), but эти аналоги пока находятся на уровне proof-of-concept и не используются в практических рабочих потоках климатических/экологических исследований. Тем не менее, quantum algorithms promise significant future improvements in computational speed and capacity for high-dimensional data typical of environmental modeling.

## Notes

- All Top-10 classical algorithms are **actively used in practical, regulatory, or operational settings** in climate and environmental sciences, as verified by fuse=1.
- Quantum analogues exist for every Top-10 algorithm; however, only a subset (Quantum Linear Regression, QSVM, Quantum PCA) are mature, while others are experimental.
- Publication frequency correlates with both real-world adoption and the development of quantum analogues.
- Research and application trends show increasing convergence between classical and quantum algorithm research, especially in environmental data science.
