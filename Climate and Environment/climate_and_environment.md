# Climate and Environment: Algorithm and Method Extraction, Mapping, and Quantum Analogue Status

## Introduction

This file documents the full process and results of algorithm and method extraction, clustering, practical use assessment, and quantum analogue mapping for the domain of Climate and Environment.

## Search Parameters

- **Keywords:** `climate AND algorithm`
- **Platforms:** arXiv, Scopus, Springer
- **Time window:** 2025–2025
- **Sample size:** 150 most relevant articles per keyword/platform combination

_Other parameters, keywords, and platforms can be adjusted as needed._

## Selection Process Overview

For each application domain D, we compile a broad list of classical algorithms and methods A known to be used in that field. We then assign an **importance score** I(A, D) to each algorithm or method based on:
- its frequency in domain-specific scientific literature, and
- whether it is confirmed to be practically used in that domain.

Formally:  
**I(A, D) = fpub(A, D) × fuse(A, D)**

where  
- `fpub(A, D)` is the normalized frequency of mentions of A in the literature (see below),  
- `fuse(A, D)` is a binary indicator: 1 if A is in practical/operational use in domain D, 0 otherwise.

## Process Summary

- Articles were collected and reviewed regardless of explicit mention of algorithms or methods in abstracts or titles.
- All classical algorithms and methods were extracted, then clustered by name and application similarity.
- For each cluster, practical use (`fuse`) was assigned based on real-world applications found in open literature, best-practice reports, and regulatory documents.
- Quantum analogue status was mapped for each practically used cluster, based on current literature in quantum machine learning.

---

## Table Legend

- **Algorithm & Method:** Standardized cluster of related algorithms and methods (variants unified).
- **mentions:** Number of literature references in the aggregated sample (2010–2024).
- **fpub:** Normalized publication frequency (fpub(A, D) = mentions / total mentions).
- **fuse:** Practical use in climate/environmental practice (`1` = yes, `0` = no).
- **I(A, D):** Importance score; only methods with I(A, D) ≥ 0.015 are considered significant for quantum mapping.

## Quantum Analogue Explanation

1. **Quantum Random Forest (QRF):**  
Quantum analogues of decision trees and ensemble methods have been proposed (see arXiv:2108.11084, 2212.02744). Implementations on NISQ platforms show potential speedup in split search and ensemble training. However, QRF is not yet an industry standard.

2. **Quantum Convolutional Neural Network (QCNN):**  
QCNN architectures based on variational quantum circuits for convolutional filters and image classifiers have been demonstrated (Nature Communications 2022, arXiv:2109.15407). They show promise for satellite imagery and agricultural data processing.

3. **Quantum Linear Regression (HHL, VQLS):**  
The most notable quantum algorithm here is the Harrow-Hassidim-Lloyd (HHL) algorithm, providing exponential speedup on sparse linear systems. The Variational Quantum Linear Solver (VQLS) offers a NISQ-compatible implementation (Nature, arXiv:1909.05820).

4. **Quantum Gradient Boosting (QGB):**  
Theoretically described in arXiv:2101.09315 and related works on Quantum XGBoost. Initial implementations target problems with a small number of features, leveraging quantum search for tree combination.

5. **Quantum Support Vector Machine (QSVM):**  
One of the most mature QML fields (Schuld & Petruccione, 2021; IBM Qiskit tutorials). QSVM achieves speedup in kernel evaluation and already has experimental realizations.

6. **Quantum LSTM (QLSTM):**  
Hybrid quantum-classical recurrent neural networks (RNNs) based on parameterized quantum circuits have been proposed (arXiv:2012.10988, 2303.10647). This field is developing rapidly but remains experimental.

7. **Quantum PCA (QPCA):**  
The original algorithm by Lloyd et al. (2014) shows speedup for dimensionality reduction tasks. Implemented on small quantum devices with promising results.

8. **Quantum Logistic Regression:**  
Classical logistic regression extended with quantum feature maps; proof-of-concept implementations exist in Qiskit and PennyLane.

9. **Quantum Monte Carlo, QAE:**  
Quantum Amplitude Estimation (QAE) is a standard building block to accelerate Monte Carlo methods (arXiv:1412.3489, Qiskit Finance). It offers proven quadratic speedup in sample complexity.

10. **Quantum Transformer, Quantum Attention:**  
Quantum circuits to implement attention and self-attention mechanisms are actively being researched (arXiv:2304.01641, 2312.05768, IBM Qiskit, PennyLane). These remain experimental but are rapidly progressing.

## Notes

- All Top-10 classical algorithms and methods are **actively used in practical, regulatory, or operational settings** in climate and environmental sciences, as verified by `fuse=1`.
- Quantum analogues exist for every Top-10 algorithm and method; however, only a subset (Quantum Linear Regression, QSVM, Quantum PCA) are mature, while others are experimental.
- Publication frequency correlates with both real-world adoption and the development of quantum analogues.
- Research and application trends show increasing convergence between classical and quantum algorithm/method research, especially in environmental data science.
