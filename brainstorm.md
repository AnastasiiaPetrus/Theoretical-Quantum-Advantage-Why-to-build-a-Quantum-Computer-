## Suggested Integration of Cross-Domain Analysis into Main Paper

To incorporate the multi-domain work into the core analysis of our paper and align with the grading criteria, I suggest the following section structure and supporting elements.

---

### ✅ 1. New Core Section: *Cross-Domain Relevance of Quantum Advantage: A Comparative Algorithmic Perspective*

> While our primary analysis focuses on climate and environmental modeling, many computational challenges encountered there—such as high-dimensional optimization, simulation of complex systems, and real-time inference—are echoed in other critical domains.  
> 
> To contextualize the theoretical justification for quantum computing, we conducted a comparative analysis of classical algorithm usage across four additional domains: **Finance and Economics**, **Logistics and Supply Management**, **Defense and Security**, and **Artificial Intelligence**.  
> 
> This section synthesizes the results, identifies recurring algorithmic bottlenecks, and evaluates the maturity of quantum analogues for each class of methods. It shows that quantum advantage is not confined to isolated cases, but rather reflects a deeper structural trend across sectors.

### ✅ 2. Summary Table: Algorithmic Patterns and Quantum Analogue Maturity Across Domains

| Domain                  | Top Classical Algorithm Types                   | Quantum Analogue Maturity           | Primary Application Focus                                |
|------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| Climate & Environment  | Linear Systems, Optimization, Simulation         | Medium–High (HHL, QAOA, QA)         | Modeling, grid optimization, materials simulation         |
| Finance & Economics    | SVM, LSTM, GA, Monte Carlo                       | High–Medium (QSVM, QAE, QGA)        | Risk, forecasting, trading, portfolio optimization        |
| Logistics              | GA, PSO, ACO, ILP                                | Medium (QA, QAOA, QGA)              | Routing, scheduling, network design                       |
| Defense & Security     | SVM, CNN, RL, LSTM                               | Medium (QSVM, QRL, QNN)             | Anomaly detection, cyber defense, situational awareness   |
| Artificial Intelligence| CNN, Transformers, Boosting, LSTM               | Medium–Low (QCNN, QBoost, QLSTM)    | Image/NLP tasks, learning efficiency, large-scale training|

### ✅ 3. Connecting to Theoretical Foundations

> This cross-domain analysis reveals that the algorithmic bottlenecks quantum computing aims to overcome—such as exponential scaling in optimization, sampling, or simulation—are ubiquitous across domains.  
>
> The presence of emerging quantum analogues for leading classical methods supports the broader claim that **quantum advantage could generalize across multiple sectors**. It strengthens the theoretical motivation for pursuing quantum computing by showing that the complexity class **BQP** likely intersects with practically relevant problem classes across science and industry.

### ✅ 4. Mini Methodology Subsection (Optional)

> **Subsection: Extension of Methodology to Multi-Domain Analysis**  
>
> The same pipeline used for the climate domain—consisting of query-based article selection, manual extraction and clustering of classical algorithms, practical use assessment, and quantum mapping—was extended to four additional domains.  
>
> Full documentation, raw data, and results for these domains are available in the companion repository:  
> [https://github.com/AnastasiiaPetrus/Theoretical-Quantum-Advantage-Why-to-build-a-Quantum-Computer-](https://github.com/AnastasiiaPetrus/Theoretical-Quantum-Advantage-Why-to-build-a-Quantum-Computer-)

### ✅ 5. Visual Aids

We can add one of the following:
- **Venn diagram** showing overlap of top algorithm types between domains (e.g. SVM, GA, CNN appear in multiple sectors).
- **Heatmap** with rows = algorithms, columns = domains, and values = importance score \( \mathcal{I}(A, D) \)

---

### ✅ 6. In-Text Reference Integration

In each domain subsection:
- Mention only the **top 3–5 algorithms** briefly.
- Refer to full tables via GitHub or appendix.
- Cite relevant quantum literature (e.g., Schuld et al. for QML, Harrow et al. for QSVM).

### ✅ 7. Clarifying Author Contributions

To meet the grading criteria regarding *methodology and contribution*, we can explicitly mention:

> The main domain analysis in this work—focused on climate and environmental modeling—was led by the first author. To test the generalizability of algorithmic insights and assess the broader relevance of quantum computing, a systematic extension to four additional domains was conducted by the second author.  
> These results confirm that the motivations for quantum advantage are not confined to one field, but rather reflect structural limitations in classical algorithm design across sectors.
