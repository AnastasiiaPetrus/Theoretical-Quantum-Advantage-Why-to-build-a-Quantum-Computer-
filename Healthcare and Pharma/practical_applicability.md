# Supplementary Table S1. Practical Use of Classical Algorithms in Healthcare and Pharma

## Overview

This supplementary material systematically maps classical algorithms to their real-world adoption in healthcare and pharmaceutical sciences. Each algorithm or method is assessed using the **fuse** (Field Use Evidence Score) criterion, which is set to `1` if the method is actively applied in practical workflows according to recent peer-reviewed literature (2024–2025); otherwise, fuse is set to `0`.

## Table Legend

- **Algorithm & Method**: Cluster of related algorithms or models (may include variants and common abbreviations).
- **fuse**:  
  - `1`: Demonstrated and established practical use in healthcare and pharma (clinical trials, diagnosis, drug discovery, precision medicine, etc.).
  - `0`: No significant evidence of practical application in the reviewed literature.

### Notes

- The fuse score is based on explicit mention or application of the algorithm or method in practical or clinical workflows, trials, or pharmaceutical applications as documented in recent publications (2024–2025).
- Methods related to classical statistics, machine learning, deep learning, and domain-specific clinical algorithms predominate the practical applications.
- Many advanced or emerging computational methods appear, but some are currently more experimental or exploratory with limited evidence of routine use.
