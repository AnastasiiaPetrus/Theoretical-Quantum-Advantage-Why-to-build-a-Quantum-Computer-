# Healthcare and Pharma: Algorithm and Method Extraction, Mapping, and Quantum Analogue Status

## Introduction

This file documents the full process and results of algorithm and method extraction, clustering, practical use assessment, and quantum analogue mapping for the domain of Healthcare and Pharma.

## Search Parameters

- **Keywords:** `healthcare and pharma AND algorithm`
- **Platforms:** PubMed, ScienceDirect
- **Time window:** 2024–2025
- **Sample size:** 100 open-access articles per keyword/platform combination

_Other parameters, keywords, and platforms can be adjusted as needed._

## Selection Process Overview

For the domain of Healthcare and Pharma \(D\), we compile a broad list of classical algorithms and methods \(A\) known to be used in the field. We then assign an **importance score** \(\mathcal{I}(A, D)\) to each algorithm or method based on:
- its frequency in domain-specific scientific literature, and
- whether it is confirmed to be practically used in that domain.

Formally:
\[
\mathcal{I}(A, D) = \mathrm{fpub}(A, D) \times \mathrm{fuse}(A, D)
\]
where  
- \(\mathrm{fpub}(A, D)\) is the normalized frequency of mentions of \(A\) in the literature (see below),  
- \(\mathrm{fuse}(A, D)\) is a binary indicator: 1 if \(A\) is in practical/operational use in domain \(D\), 0 otherwise.

## Process Summary

- Articles were collected and reviewed for explicit mentions of algorithms or methods in titles and full texts.
- All classical algorithms and methods were extracted, then clustered by name and application similarity.
- For each cluster, practical use (\(\mathrm{fuse}\)) was assigned based on real-world applications found in recent literature, case studies, and industry reports from 2024 to 2025.
- Quantum analogue status was mapped for each practically used cluster, based on current literature in quantum algorithms and quantum machine learning.

## Table Legend

- **Algorithm & Method:** Standardized cluster of related algorithms and methods (variants unified).
- **mentions:** Number of literature references in the aggregated sample (2024–2025).
- **fpub:** Normalized publication frequency (\( \mathrm{fpub}(A, D) = \frac{\text{mentions}}{\sum_{A'} \text{mentions}} \)).
- **fuse:** Practical use in healthcare and pharma (`1` = yes, `0` = no).
- **\(\mathcal{I}(A, D)\):** Importance score; only methods with \(\mathcal{I}(A, D) \geq \theta\) (here, \(\theta = 0.01\)) are considered significant for quantum mapping.
