## Notes

- Deep learning architectures (CNN, LSTM, Transformers) dominate defense and security applications.
- Classical ML models like SVM, Random Forest, and Decision Trees remain heavily used.
- Reinforcement Learning and Game Theory models are prominent in adaptive defense and attacker-defender scenarios.
- Cryptographic and post-quantum algorithms appear but less frequently, often grouped under cryptography.
- Federated Learning and privacy-preserving mechanisms are emerging strongly.
- Adversarial machine learning methods (attack/defense) receive notable attention.
- Various domain-specific algorithmic frameworks (e.g., dynamic trust evaluation, anomaly detection, intrusion detection) incorporate these core algorithmic techniques.
