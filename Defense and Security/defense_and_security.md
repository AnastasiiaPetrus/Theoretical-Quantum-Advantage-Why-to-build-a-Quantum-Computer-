# Defense and Security: Algorithm and Method Extraction, Mapping, and Quantum Analogue Status

## Introduction

This file documents the full process and results of algorithm and method extraction, clustering, practical use assessment, and quantum analogue mapping for the domain of Defense and Security.

## Search Parameters

- **Keywords:** `defense and security AND algorithm`
- **Platforms:** ACM Digital Library, arXiv, SemanticScholar
- **Time window:** 2024–2025
- **Sample size:** 150 articles per keyword/platform combination

_Other parameters, keywords, and platforms can be adjusted as needed._

## Selection Process Overview

For the domain of Defense and Security \(D\), we compile a broad list of classical algorithms and methods \(A\) known to be used in the field. We then assign an **importance score** \(\mathcal{I}(A, D)\) to each algorithm or method based on:
- its frequency in domain-specific scientific literature, and
- whether it is confirmed to be practically used in that domain.

Formally:
\[
\mathcal{I}(A, D) = \mathrm{fpub}(A, D) \times \mathrm{fuse}(A, D)
\]
where  
- \(\mathrm{fpub}(A, D)\) is the normalized frequency of mentions of \(A\) in the literature (see below),  
- \(\mathrm{fuse}(A, D)\) is a binary indicator: 1 if \(A\) is in practical/operational use in domain \(D\), 0 otherwise.

## Process Summary

- Articles were collected and reviewed for explicit mentions of algorithms or methods in titles, abstracts, and keywords.
- Classical and modern methods were extracted and unified under standardized names.
- Practical use (\(\mathrm{fuse}\)) was assigned based on real-world applications and recent literature from 2024–2025.
- Quantum analogue status was determined from current quantum computing and quantum machine learning research.

## Table Legend

- **Algorithm & Method:** Standardized cluster of related algorithms and methods (variants unified).
- **mentions:** Number of literature references in the aggregated sample (2024–2025).
- **fpub:** Normalized publication frequency (\( \mathrm{fpub}(A, D) = \frac{\text{mentions}}{\sum_{A'} \text{mentions}} \)).
- **fuse:** Practical use in defense and security (`1` = yes, `0` = no).
- **\(\mathcal{I}(A, D)\):** Importance score; only methods with \(\mathcal{I}(A, D) \geq \theta\) (here, \(\theta = 0.01\)) are considered significant for quantum mapping.

## Quantum Analogy

The leading classical algorithms in defense and security such as SVM, Random Forest, CNNs, LSTM, Reinforcement Learning, and Genetic Algorithms have emerging quantum analogues:  
- **Quantum SVM** and **Quantum PCA** are among the most mature quantum algorithms applied to classification and dimensionality reduction.  
- **Quantum CNNs** and **Quantum LSTMs** are researched for advanced pattern recognition in complex data like images and sequences.  
- Quantum versions of Reinforcement Learning are promising for adaptive cyber defense but remain largely experimental.  
- Metaheuristic quantum algorithms (QGA) aim to speed up optimization processes critical in defense strategies.  
- Federated Learning’s quantum extensions are nascent but important for privacy-preserving collaborative defense systems.

This mix of mature and emerging quantum analogues underlines significant research interest in applying quantum computing to enhance defense and security analytics.
