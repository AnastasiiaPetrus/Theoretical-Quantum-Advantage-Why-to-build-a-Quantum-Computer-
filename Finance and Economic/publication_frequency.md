## Methodology

- Extracted algorithm and method names from titles, abstracts, and keywords of 100 recent papers.
- Standardized synonymous and related algorithms under unified labels.
- Counted total mentions = 623 (aggregate from dataset).
- Normalized frequency \( fpub = \frac{\text{mentions}}{623} \) for relative importance.

## Notes

- Mentions include both direct algorithm names and closely associated variants (e.g., "BiLSTM" included under LSTM).
- Blockchain-related consensus and smart contract algorithms counted separately in other domain analysis, but here only where specifically related to finance.
- Metrics (e.g., MAE, RMSE) are not counted as algorithms but may appear in performance evaluation context.
- Algorithms like Genetic Algorithms and Particle Swarm Optimization appear often in hybrid or domain-adapted forms.
- Domain-specific algorithmic finance models (Black-Scholes, GARCH, VAR) aggregated under standard econometrics or autoregressive models.
- Game Theory algorithms included as an important but less frequently cited approach.
